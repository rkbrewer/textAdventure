textAdventure
=============

An adventure in coding &amp; cold steel. This text adventure is inspired by the 90's BBS hit sensation, LORD (as best I remember it).

Currently this is just a (working) prototype. My goal is to narrate the problem domain through good ol' fashioned expressive code.

Roadmap
-------

There's not much of a roadmap; I'd like to focus on text animations at some point, and bring my brother in for some creative writing.

It's currently written with [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), and I *do* want to transition to [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) (...[because reasons](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=angular%20js%2C%20knockout%20js%2C%20backbone%20js%2C%20ember%20js&cmpt=q)).

Coding Patterns
---------------

* Addy Osmani's [writeup on Abstract Decorators](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#decoratorpatternjavascript)
* ES5 Constructor Modules as described in Stoyan Stefanov's [JavaScript Patterns book](http://www.epubbud.com/book.php?g=U4H6WFZJ)
