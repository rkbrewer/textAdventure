What's it mean to be a warrior?  Does it mean you can take your core attributes, and shove them through an envelope?  If so, how do you handle leveling up?
Do you send those stats through a similar envelope?

Why not?


Attacks could then use character stats that were modified by your caste.

And at the time of leveling up, your incremental increase would also go through a caste envelope.


To execute on this, maintain core stats and envelope algorithms for the each caste.


This is super cool, because you could change castes to mage when you're deep into say, warrior, and you'd have the core body of a warrior.

I could do it differently than FFXIV, and have "one level, one body".  So you wouldn't be a "level 2 mage, but level 10 warrior", but rather
a "level 12 character, who just became a mage recently"...  how would battle play out? Say I was a level 50 (49 as a warrior, 1 as a mage), and
fought a level 50 mob... my magic would be so weak could I kill it?  I'd have to have the sheer strength to kill it with my stick.
